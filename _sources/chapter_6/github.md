# Chapter 6: GitHub

## Configuring Your Team's Repository

Your first task once you decide to use GitHub is to set up a repository.
You can learn how to do that
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

Once you have created a repository, there are several considerations
when establishing how your team will work with the repository.

### README

All teams should have a project level README file that explains your
project, and what your system aims to do. It should also provide some
detail as to how to use your code, along with any other useful
information (the directory structure could be useful for complex file
structures).

Teams can also add README files for separate components of the project,
such as frontend and backend, which may detail specific
commands/instructions.

### Licenses

If you are creating a repository with the intention of making it
publicly accessible eventually, you need to have a license to allow
other developers to collaborate (and to protect you from misuse). GitHub
provides a 
[detailed guide on licenses](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
along with a tool to determine which license is appropriate for your
repository.

### Branch Protection

When working on a software project, you want to ensure that critical
branches (production branches) are not accidentally tampered with or
deleted. Branch protection helps solve this by allowing developers to
configure their repository such that key branches have certain
protections that prevent deletions or require certain checks to pass
before modifications. Such branches are called **protected branches**.

Find out how to protect your branches on GitHub
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).

### Integrations

Integrations can help manage your development workflow. - Rather than
having to visit GitHub's website each time you have a pull request, you
can make use of the 
[GitHub bot](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/help/articles/232289568-GitHub-for-Slack)
on Slack to automatically send you notifications of new PRs. Discord
has a similar webhook that can be configured using this
[guide](https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22).

## Code Reviews

Code reviews involve your teammates reviewing your work to ensure that
code quality is maintained, and any errors are identified.

### Code Review Activities

-   *Pair programming:* Having two developers working on a single unit of
    work; one person writes the code (driver) whilst the other reviews
    code real-time (navigator).
-   *Pull requests:* Having 1 or more developers review code changes
    before it is merged.

### Pull Requests

```{note}
Commonly referred to as PRs.
```

Pull requests allow developers to review changes made on a certain
branch before merging it into another. When team members complete some
functionality and want it to be merged, they create a pull request,
requesting for their changes to be pulled into the main branch.
Developers can nominate reviewers to look at their pull request.
Reviewers can inspect the code and either approve the changes, or
request changes. Once approved, the developer can merge their code into
the main branch.

#### Why Use Pull Requests?

-   Team members must review and check that the code changes are
    acceptable, thereby improving code quality.
-   Errors have a greater chance of being noticed early, as there is
    more than one team member reviewing/testing the changes.
-   They improve the team's understanding of code as developers are
    forced to read other developers' code; thereby dispersing knowledge
    of the code's functionality more widely across the team.

#### Pull Request Templates

Ensuring your pull request has enough detail for a reviewer is crucial.
If the reviewer does not understand what part of functionality has been
added, they cannot provide a meaningful review. To avoid this, a pull
request template can be useful. This provides a guideline on what
information a developer should provide in the pull request, along with
any mandatory checks that have already been completed.

You can view a sample template
[here](https://unimelbcloud-my.sharepoint.com/personal/eduardo_oliveira_unimelb_edu_au/Documents/2022/SWEN90009/Book/assets/pull_request_template.md).

please see this

## Git Workflows (Branching Strategies)

A standard approach to organising Git actions within the project. Let us
consider two common strategies...

### Feature Branching

Feature branching entails creating a new branch for a new feature and
using that same branch until the feature is completed. After completion,
the feature branch is merged back into the main branch.

```

There are several flavours of feature branching but we will examine
Gitflow, by far one of the most popular branching strategies.

#### Gitflow

Gitflow relies on long-lived branches for development. There are two
main branches, main and develop, with main being the production-ready
codebase and develop reflecting changes to be made in the next release.
Developers create feature branches off develop, and when complete,
developers make a pull request to be merged into the develop branch.
When the team is ready for a release, then a new branch is created and
the code is tested before it is merged into the main branch.

| Advantages                                                  | Disadvantages                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Branches remain in a clean state.                           | Long-lived branches can be hard to integrate with the main branch; have diverged too much.               |
| Ideal for when multiple versions of a product are required. | Releases are delayed, and if there are many changes, could be highly problematic.                        |
|                                                             | Final merge from develop to the main branch can have many changes which may be overlooked by developers. |

### Trunk Based Development

Trunk based development uses short-lived branches which are regularly
merged into the trunk, reducing any delays associated with integrating
code changes.

```{figure} resources/trunk_development.png
---
name: trunk-development
---
Source:
[Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/trunk-based-development/)
```

| Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reduces likelihood of divergence from main. | Frequent merging can lead to breaking updates.                                   |
| Minimise merge conflict.                    | If slow build process, then there may be delays as people merge back into trunk. |

## Software Releases

When your team has completed a sprint or wants to make a new release,
there are several steps you should complete.

Releases are comprised of a tag and release notes.

## Tags

GitHub allows developers to create tags. These provide teams to mark key
milestones in a project by creating a tag off a certain commit. Tags are
useful in releases, and you can name a tag by the associated version
number, and that way developers can easily find all previous versions of
the production-ready software by looking at the tags.

Tags are also necessary when creating software that is not yet
production ready when working for a client. They need to be able to
access the work completed in a sprint to see changes, but if the
application is not yet live, then a tag is used to update the client on
project status.

## Release Notes

When you are creating multiple releases, it is important to explain what
key changes have been made to the product. In a commercial project,
release notes inform users of changes and clearly indicate the incentive
to upgrade to the latest version (for example,Â patching authentication
security bugs is a good incentive for users to migrate to the latest
version of a product). In your project, the release notes provide an
appropriate level of detail for your client to understand exactly what
features and capabilities are available in each release.

### Writing Good Release Notes

-   Keep it simple and avoid technical jargon.
-   Be specific about what has been implemented.
-   Group your notes logically. Creating headings for fixes,
    improvements and new features may be beneficial.

For an example, please refer to this [open-source project's release notes](https://github.com/slack-go/slack/releases).

## Creating a Release
