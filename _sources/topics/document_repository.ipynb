    "\n",
    "-   Project summary.\n",
    "-   Details of the client, supervisor, and development team.\n",

    "pages. Over the semester, you will be required to hold team, client, and\n",
    "supervisor meetings, and you are expected to keep minutes for all\n",
    "meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one logical way of structuring the Confluence space could be:\n",

    "---\n",
    "name: meetings\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be a relative frequency of meetings. Supervisor meetings\n",
    "should occur weekly, team meetings should occur a few times each week,\n",
    "and client meetings should occur every few weeks. It is very important\n",
    "you create a log of each meeting:\n",

    "```{figure} resources/meeting_structure.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: meeting_structure\n",

    "In the meeting page itself, your team should log:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Agenda, so teammates can create questions in advance of the meeting.\n",
    "-   Participants present during the meeting.\n",
    "-   A video and audio recording of the meetings (only necessary for client meetings).\n",
    "-   All discussion items and decisions reached.\n",
    "-   All action items with an assigned teammate who is responsible for\n",
    "    the action.\n",
