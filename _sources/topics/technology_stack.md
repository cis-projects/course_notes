# Technology Stack

Unlike most of your other subjects, this subject does not have a
pre-defined technology stack you must use.

There is no right or wrong answer as to your choice of technology stacks
for your web application.

However, you should consider several factors:

- The desires of your client.
- The knowledge and experience of your teammates.
- The desire to learn something new.
- Time and budget limitations.

Like any other decision, the decision for a technology stack requires
weighing the options and deciding as a team.

Modern web frameworks are comprised of a frontend framework, backend
framework, web server, and data persistence.

There are many choices available for tech stacks, some of the most
popular are detailed below.

## Front-End Frameworks

Your main two choices are between HTML and CSS, and JavaScript for the
front-end. If you choose to use HTML and CSS,
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
is a framework to take work out of development.

There are several JavaScript frameworks to help your development:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## Back-End Frameworks

| Language | Framework                                                                                                                                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python   | - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)<br/>- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)<br/>- [Pylons](https://pylonsproject.org/) |
| Java     | -[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)                                                                                           |
| Ruby     | - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)                                                                                                      |
| PHP      | - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)                                                                                                                |

## Databases

Your web application needs a place to store all data (user,
configuration, etc. data).

| Name                                      | Type                        |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)           | Relational                  |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)       | Non-relational<br/>Document |
| [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Relational                  |

## Web Servers

And lastly, your web application needs a web server to handle requests.

-   [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
-   [Apache](https://www.apache.org/)
