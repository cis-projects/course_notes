# Confluence

In the lifecycle of a software engineering project, teams generate substantial amounts of knowledge, including software requirements, architectural designs, and testing documentation. This wealth of information requires a centralised storage solution to ensure it remains accessible to all team members and can be efficiently handed over to the client upon project completion. Document repositories address this need by serving as the central hub for all project-related information.

## Why Confluence?

While various document repository platforms are available, Confluence is highly recommended for its widespread industry adoption and compatibility with software engineering practices. Known for its robustness and flexibility, Confluence is an invaluable tool for students aspiring to careers in software engineering, as familiarity with it opens doors in companies that prioritise agile and collaborative work environments.

## Setting Up Your Team's Confluence Space

Creating a dedicated space on Confluence for your project is the foundational step towards efficient project documentation and management. Typically, one team member initiates this process by establishing the space and granting access to the rest of the team. However, in certain courses, this space may be pre-configured by a project mentor. Always verify the process with your subject coordinator to ensure compliance with course requirements.

### Initial Steps

1. **Create the Space:** [Your project mentor] will follow the Confluence guidelines to create a new space for your project. Only project mentor needs to perform this action.
2. **Grant Access:** Project mentor will ensure every team member has access to the space to contribute and retrieve information seamlessly.

## Structuring Your Confluence Space

A well-organised Confluence space is crucial for navigation ease and information retrieval efficiency. The following sections outline a recommended structure for your project space.

### Home Page Setup

The home page acts as the gateway to your project's documentation, providing a snapshot of essential information:

- **Project Summary:** An overview of the project's objectives and scope.
- **Team Details:** Contact information and roles for the client, supervisor, and development team members.
- **Important Links:** Direct links to ancillary tools, such as task tracking systems and code repositories.

### Meeting Documentation

Regular meetings are a staple of agile project management, necessitating a structured approach to documenting discussions, decisions, and action items. Consider organising your meeting documentation as follows:

- **Meeting Pages:** Dedicate pages for different meeting types (team, client, supervisor) with a consistent structure for ease of access.
- **Meeting Frequency:** Clearly outline the expected frequency of each meeting type to maintain regular communication and project momentum.

#### Meeting Page Contents

Each meeting page should comprehensively capture the following elements:

- **Agenda:** Prepared in advance to guide the meeting's discussions.
- **Participants:** A record of attendees for accountability and reference.
- **Recordings:** Video and audio recordings of the meetings, particularly important for client interactions.
- **Discussion Summary:** Key points and decisions made during the meeting.
- **Action Items:** Tasks assigned to team members, including deadlines and responsibilities.

## Important Considerations

- **Thoughtful Structure:** Invest time in planning the layout of your Confluence space to prevent information overlap and ensure easy access.
- **Avoid Duplication:** A well-organised repository minimises the risk of redundant work, saving time and resources.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all project stakeholders can find necessary documentation, which is critical for client satisfaction and assessment purposes.

By adhering to these guidelines, your team can leverage Confluence to its full potential, enhancing project management, collaboration, and documentation practices. This foundation will not only contribute to the success of your current project but also prepare you for future endeavors in the field of software engineering.
