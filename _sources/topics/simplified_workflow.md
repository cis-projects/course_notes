# A Simplified Workflow

For those unfamiliar with everything covered so far, it might not be
clear how it all ties together. The use of a code repository, task
tracker, and document repository all tie together to create a unified
and organised workflow.

Taking an example, a team that uses:

-   Jira for task tracking.
-   GitHub for the code repository.
-   Confluence for the document repository.

Bringing all of this together, allows for a workflow that can be
monitored and scaled as the team and work grows.
