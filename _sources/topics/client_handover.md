# Client Handover

At the end of the semester, you are required to hand over your web application to your client in a state that will 
allow them to continue development. That means they must be given accurate information and develop an understanding of 
the current state of the application.

You are required to hold a meeting with the client in which you will discuss and demonstrate the final delivered 
application and the user stories implemented (and those not implemented). 
In the meeting you should hand over a tag of the code repository, which should include:

- All code developed throughout the semester.
- The correct code license with ownership transferred to the client.
- Populated READMEs with a clear description of the repository structure.
- Details on how to access the database and the credentials required to access it.
- Details on how to access the hosting service and the credentials required to access it.
- Details of all data stored in the database (this includes user data used for testing, etc.).
- An export of the entire document repository including all work completed throughout the semester.
- A manual showing the use cases of the system (you can use your acceptance testing here).
- Instruction on how to start-up and shutdown the application.
