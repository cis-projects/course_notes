# Final Presentation

The final presentation is your opportunity to showcase your product to
supervisors, other teams, and your client. Each team will have
approximately 15 minutes to walk through their project and demo their
application.

## What Should Be Covered?

Your team's presentation should cover the following (in no order):

-   Introduction to your team: who you are, what you did.
-   Business need: what drove the initial requirement for the product
    you developed.
-   Project requirements: how did you work with your client to develop
    requirements.
-   Target users/personas: who will use the application you have
    developed.
-   Project process:
    -   The design of the system.
    -   An overview of your application's architecture.
-   Project outcomes: what was delivered;
-   Application demonstration:
    -   This should be a demonstration of your fully deployed
        application.
    -   Develop a narrative for your demonstration and utilise personas
        to complete tasks using the application.
-   Key challenges and accomplishments.


```{attention}
The presentations should be easy to follow by the audience, and
you should assume your audience has no prior knowledge of your
application (you will likely be marked by academic staff that have never
seen your work prior to the demonstration).
```

## Presenters

**All** team members are required to speak during the presentation.

## Tools to Take Your Presentation to the Next Level

Whilst PowerPoint is a great for making slide decks, the templates
provided are limited. To make your presentation more professional, we
encourage you to find templates online that match the branding of your
application. We recommend you look at the following websites for modern
PowerPoint templates:

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_au/)
- [Adobe Creative Cloud Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/)

## During the Demonstration

-   *Develop tasks and use personas to complete the tasks:* Teams are
    required to demonstrate their application during their presentation.
    We recommend walking through your application as if you were the
    target user. Employing personas can help make the presentation more
    engaging.
-   *Demonstrate high value features*: As you decide what features to
    showcase, remember that you should show the functionality that is of
    high value to your client. You need to show how the application you
    built meets your client's expectations. Activities such as
    authentication can be omitted as it rarely is a specific requirement
    from the client. You can use the user stories priorities to decide
    what is of high value to the client.
-   *Use realistic data:* When demonstrating, it is important to use
    realistic data where possible. You are trying to show how a
    real-life customer would use the application, and so the data should
    be realistic, too. We recommend teams to have their mock data
    written or saved somewhere so the demonstrator knows exactly what to
    use.
-   *Preparing for failure is also important as things can go wrong
    during a demonstration.* Sometimes the application may not be
    predictable, or you may discover a bug mid-demonstration. Practicing
    can help reduce the likelihood of this occurring, but teams should
    still have a plan for what to do in case of failure. Having an
    authenticated session ready as a backup can be useful, or having
    another student stand-by to take-over, if one student is having
    issues.

```{tip}
-   Hold practice presentation to iron out timing and transitions.
-   Practice presenting to a friend or family member who has no
    background knowledge of the project - if they can follow along and
    understand your demonstration, that is a good sign.
-   Have a practice run through on the day.
-   Practice the timing of your presentation.
-   Keep your slides succinct, as overloading slides with text can make
    them more difficult to follow - try replacing text with graphics
    where it makes sense.
-   If the presentations are being held virtually:
    -   Use a consistent virtual background as a team.
    -   Add your group name to your Zoom handle.
    -   Make sure your audio and video are clear.
-   Practice how you will transition between speakers.
