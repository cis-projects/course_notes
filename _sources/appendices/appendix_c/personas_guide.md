# Appendix C: Tools for Personas

There are different tools you can use to create your personas. In this tutorial, we will introduce tools to you.

## This Person Does Not Exist

This tool is to be used in conjunction with other tools that help you create personas. It uses AI to create photos 
of people who do not actually exist. Every time you refresh their website, a new photo is generated. You can use 
this tool for the photos of your personas.

Please don’t use real people’s photo (unless they give you the permission) in your personas. If you use other 
people’s photo without asking their permission, it could result in privacy breaches.

## Hubspot - Make My Persona

```{warning}
For the persona photo, you can only use a pre-defined set of avatar (around 15 choices) - no real 
images options. You cannot copy and paste photos either. For this reason, we recommend that you use other 
tools instead.

If you search for Hubspot persona on Google, you might find 
[this tutorial](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/create-and-edit-personas). This is VERY DIFFERENT 
to the Make My Persona tool. Please don't use this one.
```

- Firstly, you do NOT need a Hubspot account to use this tool. Visit 
[this link](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona).
- Once you click the "Build My Persona" button, it will take you through a 7-steps tour to create your persona. 
- Or, you can just choose to skip the walk-through mode and edit it yourself.
```{figure} resources/make_my_persona1.jpg
---
name: make_my_persona1
```

```{figure} resources/make_my_persona2.jpg
---
name: make_my_persona2
```

- Either way, you will get the chance to edit/add/delete sections at the end.

### Save and Export

Yes - you can save this persona and edit it later. What you do is: 
- Once you finish the 7-steps tour, or you have chosen the option to skip the tour, you will arrive at a 
"Make My Persona Overview" page. 
- Click the save button.
```{figure} resources/make_my_persona3.jpg
---
name: make_my_persona3
```

- It will ask you to fill in some personal details.
- After you have filled in your personal details, click the "Download Now" button.
```{figure} resources/make_my_persona4.jpg
---
name: make_my_persona4
```

- You can download your persona as a PDF. You will also be given a link that you can use to access it in the 
future, or share with your team members.

```

## PersonaGenerator

This tool is pretty straight-forward. After you visit [this link](https://personagenerator.com/), you can start 
creating your persona by filling in content.

### Save and Export

- You get two links: one is view-only, one allows editing. You can share the two links in your team to edit/view 
your personas.
- You can print the persona as a PDF. 

### Disadvantages

You **cannot** change the section title, add a new section or delete a section. In other words, the sections you can 
have on your persona are fixed. Please consider this before you choose this tool. 

## UXPRESSIA

- To use this tool, create an account with UXPRESSIA for free. Visit 
[this link](https://uxpressia.com/personas-online-tool).
- Firstly, you need to sign up. 
- After you have signed up successfully, you will arrive at your personal workspace. Create a project.
```{figure} resources/uxpressia1.jpg
---
name: uxpressia1
```

- In your project, you can create your persona. Click "ADD NEW"
```{figure} resources/uxpressia2.jpg
---
name: uxpressia2
```

- Select "PERSONAS". You can start with a blank one, then edit it yourself.
```{figure} resources/uxpressia3.jpg
---
name: uxpressia3
```

- Uxpressia allows you to be very flexible with your sections - you can add/delete them, and there are different 
types of sections to choose from (e.g. text, sliders).
```{figure} resources/uxpressia4.jpg

name: uxpressia4
```

### Disadvantages

The following restrictions are limitations of a free plan:
1. You can only create one persona per project. 
2. You can only create one project per account
3. You can only export it as a PNG.
4. To share your persona, you need to share your project first. The free plan only let you share your project with 
1 person via email. 

```{tip}
You could form small teams of 2 within the team to work on a persona. For review, the smaller teams can 
exchange their personas. You will need to create multiple accounts with UXPRESSIA.
```
