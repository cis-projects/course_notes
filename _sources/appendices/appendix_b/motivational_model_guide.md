## Creating a Model

Once the project teams are finalised, teaching team will create a
project including all the team members of your team in the MMTool. An
announcement will be posted in the Canvas LMS.

All the members of a team should be able to view the project in your
dashboard as shown in Figure 1.

```{note}
Project Name (Team Name) should not be renamed.
```

### Creating a Model Under a Project

1. Click on '+' under 'Create Model' in Figure 1 to create a new model.
2. Enter model name in the displayed 'New Model' window and click
    'Create':

3. On clicking Create in the New Model window, user will be navigated
    to the Write Goal List tab of the Model.

4. To Rename the model:

- Click on stack button corresponding to a model in project folder:

### Steps to Create a Motivational Model

MMTool consists of three tabs:

- Write Goal List: to enter Do, Be, Feel, Concern and Who goals.
- Cluster Goals/Arrange into Hierarchy: to create cluster in the
    right pane by dragging and dropping the goals from
    Do/Be/Feel/Concern/Who lists from left pane.
- Render Model: to render model from the cluster created.

### Step 1: Write Goal List

The motivational model uses four notations to denote the goals
associated with the project:

- Parallelogram to represent a functional goal.
- Cloud to represent a quality goal.
- Heart to represent an emotional goal (Inverted heart to represent
    concern).
- Person figure to represent the users/stakeholders.

Steps to create Do/Be/Feel/Who lists in the MMTool:

1.  Do/Be/Feel/Who lists developed on paper during requirements
    elicitation can be uploaded in the left pane of Write Goal List tab.
2.  Click 'Upload Image' button and select the image to upload from your
    personal device:

![](resources/image6.png)

3.  Enter New Functional Goal under Do in the right pane of Write Goal
    List tab.

4.  User will be able to enter required number of goals by pressing
    Enter on keyboard.

![](resources/image8.png)

5.  Click on 'Be' in the right pane to enter New Quality Goal:

![](resources/image9.png)

6. Similarly, click on 'Feel' to enter the emotional goals, 'Concern'
    to enter negative goals and 'Who' to enter the roles associated with
    the project.
7. *To Delete the uploaded image*: Click **\'X\'** in the top-right
    corner of the uploaded image:

![](resources/image10.png)

8. *To Delete the entered goals*: Place the cursor on the goal that
    needs to be deleted and click delete icon corresponding to the goal
    in the list:

![](resources/image11.png)

9. *To Rename the entered goals*: Click on the corresponding goal in
    the list to get the cursor and rename the goal:

### Step 2: Cluster Goals/Arrange into Hierarchy

1. Click on 'Cluster Goals/Arrange into Hierarchy' tab.
2. The lists created in the 'Write Goal List' tab are displayed on the
    left pane in the 'Cluster Goals/Arrange into Hierarchy' tab:

![](resources/image13.png)

3. Select a goal to drag and drop into 'Drag here to create a new
    cluster' area of the tab:

![](resources/image14.png)

4. When a goal is dropped in the 'Drag here to create a new cluster'
    area, it is by default placed at the bottom of the hierarchy. Click
    on the goal in the hierarchy and re-drag it to the required level.
5. Goals aligned in the same column will be on the same level in the
    rendered model in step 3.

To create a hierarchy,

- Considering a model as a tree, the major goal of project is
    represented as a root node and is placed at the top of the
    hierarchy.
- The high-level functional requirements (functional goals) of the
    project can be further divided into subtrees and are aligned right
    at one level under the root node.

```{tip}
Click on the goal and move the goal slightly to the right side. Once
the goal is moved to the right position, a hyphen, -, will appear
denoting the level of subtree.
```

![](resources/image15.png)

- Activities related to each subtree are further extended to detail
    the associated goals and are right aligned at one level to the
    subtree.
- Click on the goal and move the goal slightly to the right side. Once
    the goal is moved to the right position, a hyphen, -, will appear
    denoting the level of subtree.
- The goals can be re-dragged to the upper level of the hierarchy by
    clicking on the goal and moving them to the left.
- All the goals in the lists can be dragged and dropped at the
    required level in the **'**Drag here to create a new cluster' area.

6. The goals in do/be/feel/concern/who lists can be edited in 'Write
    Goal List', 'Cluster Goals/Arrange into Hierarchy' and 'Render
    Model' tabs of MMTool.

### Step 3: Render Model

1. Click on the 'Render Model' tab to render the model:

![](resources/image17.png)

2. Click on 'Render' button in the top-right corner of 'Render Model'
    tab to render the motivational model from the hierarchy created in
    the Step 2.
3. The model rendered is:

![](resources/image18.png)

4. The shapes may overlap in the rendered model. Model needs to be
    adjusted manually to make it presentable and clear:

![](resources/image19.png)

5. Click on 'Save' button present at the top to save the model:

![](resources/image20.png)

6. Click on 'Export' button at the top-right corner to export the
    rendered model:

![](resources/image21.png)

7. In the rendered model:

- The notations (parallelogram, cloud, heart, and person) used in the
    model can be expandable and shrinkable.
- The text in the notations is editable.
- The position of the notations is adjustable.

## Writing Notes

Click on 'Notes' button in the top-right corner of the model to write
any information related to the team discussion as required:
