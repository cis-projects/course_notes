# Appendix C: Tools for Personas

There are different tools you can use to create your personas. In this tutorial, we will introduce 4 tools to you.

## Hubspot - Make My Persona

- Firstly, you do NOT need a Hubspot account to use this tool. Visit 
[this link](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona).
- Once you click the "Build My Persona" button, it will take you through a 7-steps tour to create your persona. 
- Or, you can just choose to skip walkthrough mode and edit it yourself.

- Either way, you will get the chance to edit/add/delete sections at the end. 

### Save and Export

Yes - you can save this persona and edit it later. What you do is: 
1. Once you finish the 7-steps tour, or you have chosen the option to skip the tour, you will arrive at a 
"Make My Persona Overview" page. 
2. Click the save button.

### Any Disadvantages?

For the persona photo, you can only use a pre-defined set of avatar (around 15 choices) - no real images options. 
You cannot copy and paste photos either.

```{warning}
If you search for Hubspot persona on Google, you might find 
[this tutorial](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts/create-and-edit-personas). 
This is **VERY DIFFERENT** to the Make My Persona tool. Please don't use this one. 
```

## PersonaGenerator

This tool is pretty straight-forward. After you visit [this link](https://personagenerator.com/), you can start 
creating your persona by filling in content.

### Save and Export

- You get two links: one is view-only, one allows editing. You can share the two links in your team to edit/view 
your personas.
- You can print the persona as a PDF. 

### Any disadvantages?

You **cannot** change the section title, add a new section or delete a section. In other words, the sections you can 
have on your persona are fixed. Please consider this before you choose this tool. 

## UXPRESSIA

1. To use this tool, create an account with UXPRESSIA for free. Visit

2. Firstly, you need to sign up.

6. Uxpressia allows you to be very flexible with your sections - you can add/delete them, and there are different 
types of sections to choose from (e.g. text, sliders).

### Any Disadvantages?

The following restrictions are limitations of a free plan:
1. You can only create one persona per project. 
2. You can only create one project per account

exchange their personas. You will need to create multiple accounts with UXPRESSIA.
