## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including code, text, images, and more, based on the training data they have been fed. In software engineering, generative AI can assist in various tasks, such as coding, documentation, and testing, thereby augmenting the development process.

## Responsible Practices

As part of our commitment to fostering innovative and ethical software engineering practices, we provide various resources, including generative AI prompts, to enhance your learning experience and project outcomes. It's crucial to approach these tools with a mindset geared towards responsible use and collaboration. When using generative AI in software engineering, consider the following practices to ensure effectiveness, responsibility, awareness and integrity:

- **Understand the Limitations**: Recognise that generative AI tools are not infallible and should be used as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment.
- **Verify the Output**: Always review and test the code or content generated by AI to ensure it meets your project's requirements and standards.
- **Cite Your Sources**: If your project or research benefits from generative AI, make sure to acknowledge the use of these tools in your documentation.
- **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Be cautious when feeding sensitive or proprietary data into generative AI systems, as this may raise privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is especially important in the context of capstone subjects where you have a chance to work with real-world industry partners.

### AI as a Collaborative Tool

Generative AI offers significant potential to aid in the creative and development processes. However, it's essential to view AI as a partner, not a replacement for your work, contributions and critical thinking. Use AI to generate ideas, draft solutions, and explore possibilities, but remember that the final outcome should reflect your unique contribution and understanding. You are in control and should continue to make informed-decisions in this process.

### Responsibility and Ownership

While AI can automate parts of the creative software development process, the responsibility for the project's integrity, quality, and ethical considerations remains entirely with you. Do not delegate critical decisions or ethical judgments to AI. Instead, if you decide to use genAI in your software development process, use AI-generated content as a starting point for further development and refinement. The use of these technologies must be continuously reviewed and discussed with your team.

### Critical Review and Informed Decisions

Again, every piece of AI-generated content should be critically evaluated and reviewed. Inspect/Examine the relevance, accuracy, and appropriateness of the content in the context of your project. It's your responsibility to ensure that the final product aligns with the project's objectives, ethical standards, and technical requirements. 

### Staying in Control

Maintain control over the use of AI in your projects. Ensure that its application enhances the project's value without compromising your learning objectives or the project's integrity. The use of AI should be transparent, and its contributions should be clearly acknowledged in your project documentation.

### Ethical Considerations and Academic Integrity

Adhere to principles of academic integrity and ethical conduct in all interactions with AI tools. The generation of content using AI must be aligned with the guidelines provided by the University of Melbourne. Misuse of AI, such as passing off AI-generated content as entirely your own original work without proper acknowledgment, can lead to academic misconduct.


## Recommendations

- **Start Small**: Initially, use generative AI for smaller tasks as you become familiar with its capabilities and limitations.
- **Collaborate and Discuss**: Use generative AI as a tool for brainstorming and collaboration among team members, enhancing creativity and efficiency.
- **Stay Updated**: Generative AI technology is rapidly evolving. Keep yourself updated on the latest developments and tools that can benefit your projects. When in doubt, ask your subject coordinator for advice.
