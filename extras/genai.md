## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including code, text, images, and more, based on the training data they have been fed. In software engineering, generative AI can assist in various tasks, such as coding, documentation, and testing, thereby augmenting the development process.

## Good Practices

When using generative AI in software engineering, consider the following practices to ensure effectiveness, responsibility, awareness and integrity:

- **Understand the Limitations**: Recognise that generative AI tools are not infallible and should be used as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment.
- **Verify the Output**: Always review and test the code or content generated by AI to ensure it meets your project's requirements and standards.
- **Cite Your Sources**: If your project or research benefits from generative AI, make sure to acknowledge the use of these tools in your documentation.
- **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Be cautious when feeding sensitive or proprietary data into generative AI systems, as this may raise privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is especially important in the context of capstone subjects where you have a chance to work with real-world industry partners.

## Recommendations

- **Start Small**: Initially, use generative AI for smaller tasks as you become familiar with its capabilities and limitations.
- **Collaborate and Discuss**: Use generative AI as a tool for brainstorming and collaboration among team members, enhancing creativity and efficiency.
- **Stay Updated**: Generative AI technology is rapidly evolving. Keep yourself updated on the latest developments and tools that can benefit your projects. When in doubt, ask your subject coordinator for advice.
