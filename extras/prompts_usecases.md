# Generating Use Cases from User Stories

In software engineering, translating user stories into use cases is a crucial step in the requirements engineering process. This transformation helps bridge the gap between user needs and the functional design of the system. Use cases provide a detailed description of how users interact with the system to achieve their goals, offering a clearer, step-by-step narrative that developers and stakeholders can follow.

## The Importance of Use Cases

Use cases extend user stories by adding context and specificity, making them invaluable for:
- **Design and Implementation**: Guiding the development team in building the system's functionality.
- **Testing and Validation**: Serving as a basis for creating test cases and ensuring the system meets user expectations.
- **Communication**: Facilitating a common understanding among all project stakeholders.

## Generating Use Cases: A Guided Approach

To generate use cases from user stories, we can use the following structured prompt with generative AI:

```markdown
Given the user story: [Insert User Story Here],
Generate a detailed use case, including:
- Title: A concise title for the use case.
- Actor: The user or system initiating the use case.
- Preconditions: Conditions that must be true before the use case begins.
- Main Flow: A step-by-step description of the interaction between the actor and the system to achieve the goal.
- Alternate Flows: Any variations in the interaction sequence.
- Postconditions: The state of the system after the use case completes.
```

### Example: From User Stories to Use Cases

#### User Story 1
- As Alex, I want to easily create a professional profile highlighting my teaching philosophy and preferred subjects so that potential employers can understand my unique approach to education.

#### Generated Use Case
**Use Case Name**: Creating a Professional Profile

1. **Actor**: Alex
2. **Precondition**: Alex is registered and logged into the system.
3. **Main Flow**:
   - Alex selects the option to create a new professional profile.
   - Alex is prompted to enter details about their teaching philosophy and preferred subjects.
   - The system validates the entered information and saves the profile.
   - The system displays a confirmation message that the profile is successfully created.
4. **Postconditions**: Alex's professional profile is visible to potential employers.
5. **Exceptions**:
   - If any required information is missing, Alex is prompted to complete all fields.

#### User Story 2
- As Alex, I want to filter job opportunities by location and accessibility features so that I can find schools that match my needs and values.

#### Generated Use Case
**Use Case Name**: Filtering Job Opportunities

1. **Actor**: Alex
2. **Precondition**: Alex has accessed the job opportunities section.
3. **Main Flow**:
   - Alex inputs preferred location and accessibility features into the filter criteria.
   - The system retrieves and displays a list of job opportunities matching the criteria.
   - Alex reviews the filtered job opportunities.
4. **Postconditions**: Alex can identify and select job opportunities that match their preferences.
5. **Exceptions**:
   - If no matches are found, the system informs Alex and suggests adjusting the filter criteria.
