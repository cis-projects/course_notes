# # Document Repository (Confluence)
# 
# Throughout the semester, you and your team will generate a lot of
# knowledge - in the form of software requirements, architecture, and
# testing documents, etc. This knowledge will need to be centrally stored,
# so it is accessible to the entire team and to the client at handover.
# 
# Document repositories solve this issue by acting as a central store of
# all project information and should be the first place your team
# references when searching for information.
# 
# There are many options for document repository software, but in this
# subject, we strongly encourage the use of Confluence.
# 
# Confluence is the industry leader and is a good tool to familiarise
# yourself with, if you wish to work as a software engineer as most
# companies use it.
# 
# ## Creating Your Team's Space
# 
# The first step is to create your team's Confluence space. Only one team
# member needs to do this and then grant every other team member access.
# 
# To set up the space, please follow these instructions:

# ## Set Up Your Space
# 
# Once created, it is very important to structure your space in a way that
# makes it easy to navigate.
# 
# You can begin by setting up your home page. The home page should
# contain:
# 
# -   Project summary.
# -   Details of the client, supervisor, and development team.
# -   Important links to other tools, for example, links to task tracking,
#     code repository, etc.
# 
# ```{figure} resources/home_page.png
# ---
# name: home_page
# ---
# ```
# 
# Once the home page is set up, the next pages to create are meeting
# pages. Over the semester, you will be required to hold team, client, and
# supervisor meetings, and you are expected to keep minutes for all
# meetings.
# 
# So, one logical way of structuring the Confluence space could be:
# 
# ```{figure} resources/meetings.png
# ---
# name: meetings
# ---
# ```
# 
# There should be a relative frequency of meetings. Supervisor meetings
# should occur weekly, team meetings should occur a few times each week,
# and client meetings should occur every few weeks. It is very important
# you create a log of each meeting:
# 
# ```{figure} resources/meeting_structure.png
# ---
# name: meeting_structure
# ---
# ```
# 
# In the meeting page itself, your team should log:
# 
# -   Agenda, so teammates can create questions in advance of the meeting.
# -   Participants present during the meeting.
# -   A video and audio recording of the meetings (only necessary for client meetings).
# -   All discussion items and decisions reached.
# -   All action items with an assigned teammate who is responsible for
#     the action.
# 
# ```{figure} resources/meeting_page.png
# ---
# name: meeting_page
# ---
# ```
# 
# ```{warning}
# Throughout the semester you will be developing a
# lot of resources that will need to be stored in Confluence. Please make
# sure you put thought into the structure of your space. If a teammate is
# unable to find work, it may result in duplication of tasks. If the
# client or marker is unable to find work, they may believe you have not
# done it.
# ```
