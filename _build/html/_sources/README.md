The purpose of this book is to act as a resource for students to consult throughout the semester while undertaking one of the below subjects:

- [SWEN30006 Software Modelling and Design](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen30006)
- [SWEN90007 Software Design and Architecture](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90007)
- [SWEN90009 Software Requirements Analysis](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90009)
- [SWEN90014 Masters Software Engineering Project](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90014)
- [SWEN90013 Masters Advanced Software Project](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90013)
- [COMP90082 Software Project](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp90082)

These subjects all involve either the development of requirements of a software system or the implementation of that system into code from requirements.

For many students, this is the first time you will be working in teams using agile methodologies, working with a client, and potentially even the first time you are developing software requirements (rather than the requirements being given to you from a university professor). As such, the learning curve for this subject can be steep for some.

This handbook should help you acclimate yourselves to content learned throughout the semester and can be used as a
resource to reference when you have questions.
