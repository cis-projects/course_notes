# Client Handover

The client handover phase marks a critical milestone in your capstone project, signifying the transition of the web application from development to potential real-world use. This phase requires meticulous preparation to ensure the client receives all necessary information and resources to understand, utilise, and further develop the application if needed.

## Preparing for the Handover Meeting

The culmination of your project development is the handover meeting with your client. This meeting's primary goal is to present the final state of the web application, covering both the accomplishments and any limitations. To ensure a successful handover, consider the following steps:

### Schedule the Meeting

- Arrange a meeting time that is convenient (between weeks 12 and 14) for both your team and the client, allowing ample time for thorough discussion and demonstration.

### Prepare Your Presentation

- Plan a structured presentation that covers all critical aspects of the application, including implemented user stories and any features or user stories that were not completed.
- Include a live demonstration of the application to showcase its functionality and how it meets the project requirements.

### Finalise the Code Repository

Prior to the meeting, ensure that the code repository is organised and contains everything the client might need:

- **Codebase:** Include all source code developed during the semester, ensuring it's the latest and most stable version.
- **License:** Ensure the codebase is accompanied by an appropriate license agreement, transferring ownership rights to the client as agreed upon.
- **README Files:** Populate README files with detailed descriptions of the repository structure, making it easier for the client or future developers to navigate the project.
- **Database Access:** Provide comprehensive details on accessing the database, including necessary credentials and an overview of the data schema.
- **Hosting Service Access:** Include instructions and credentials for accessing the hosting service where the application is deployed.
- **Data Documentation:** Document all data stored within the database, particularly emphasising test data or dummy user information.
- **Project Documentation:** Export and organise the entire document repository, ensuring all project documentation is easily accessible, including design documents, meeting minutes, and development logs.
- **User Manual:** Create a user manual highlighting the system's use cases, ideally leveraging your acceptance testing documentation to guide the client through the application’s features and functionalities.
- **Startup and Shutdown Instructions:** Provide clear instructions for starting up and shutting down the application, ensuring the client can easily manage the application's operational status.

## Conducting the Handover Meeting

- **Demonstrate the Application:** Walk the client through the application, emphasising how it addresses the initial project requirements and any specific functionalities that were a focus of the development.
- **Discuss the Code and Documentation:** Guide the client through the code repository, highlighting the structure, key components, and any important documentation that accompanies the code.
- **Review Outstanding Items:** Clearly communicate any unimplemented features or user stories, including reasons why they were not completed and suggestions for future development.
- **Feedback and Questions:** Allocate time for the client to provide feedback and ask questions. This is crucial for ensuring they fully understand the application and what has been delivered.

## After the Handover Meeting

- **Provide Contact Information:** While the formal project period may be over, it’s helpful to offer contact information for further queries or clarifications.
- **Follow-Up:** Send a follow-up email thanking the client for their collaboration, including a summary of the handover meeting and links to the repository and documentation for easy reference.

## Conclusion

The client handover is more than a formality; it's the final step in delivering a product that could see real-world use. By carefully preparing and conducting the handover meeting, you ensure that your project has a lasting impact beyond the academic environment, setting the stage for future development and deployment.
