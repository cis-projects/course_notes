<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of these course notes is to act as a resource for students to consult throughout the semester while
undertaking one of the below subjects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen30006">SWEN30006 Software Modelling and Design</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90009">SWEN90009 Software Requirements Analysis</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90014">SWEN90014 Masters Software Engineering Project</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/swen90013">SWEN90013 Masters Advanced Software Project</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp90082">COMP90082 Software Project</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These subjects all involve either the development of requirements of a software system or the implementation of that
system into code from requirements.</p>
<p>For many students, this is the first time you will be working in teams using agile methodologies, working with a
client, and potentially even the first time you are developing software requirements (rather than the requirements
being given to you from a university professor). As such, the learning curve for this subject can be steep for some.</p>
<p>This handbook should help you acclimate yourselves to content learned throughout the semester and can be used as a
resource to reference when you have questions.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>This handbook will act as a living guide, so please feel free to raise an issue in the top right-hand side of this
website, if you want to raise suggestions or advice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Agile Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1-agile-methodology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this subject, you will form teams and operate according to the agile
methodology. This chapter will help familiarise students with the agile
framework for project management and software development.</p>

<h3>Software Development Lifecycles (SDLCs)<a class="headerlink" href="#software-development-lifecycles-sdlcs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Software development lifecycles (SDLCs) refer to a process for planning,
developing, testing, and deploying a software system. There are two main

<p>Agile was formed after teams were frustrated by the rigidity of formal
methods, and their inability to adapt to change easily without exceeding
cost and time constraints. For example, in Waterfall, teams complete all
the requirements work before moving to design and subsequently
development. If the requirements changed during the development phase,
the team would need to start over, costing significant time and money,
something that is not feasible in many situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="agile-manifesto">
<h3>Agile Manifesto<a class="headerlink" href="#agile-manifesto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Agile, much like its name, focuses on being able to adapt to change
rapidly through developing software incrementally. The agile manifesto
explains the core values and principles that are the basis of Agile:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</p></li>
<li><p>Responding to change over following a plan.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrum-framework">
<h3>Scrum Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#scrum-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For this subject, you will work in agile teams following the Scrum
framework.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-scrum">
<h4>What is Scrum?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-scrum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Scrum is a framework used to implement an Agile mindset. It focuses on ensuring teams
work together, embodying the values from the agile manifesto. Scrum is based on teams
working iteratively, in time-boxed sprints (typically 2-4 weeks), with a predetermined
set of tasks. During sprint planning, the team decides which tasks to work on during
the upcoming sprint, to ensure they maximise value to their client. If requirements
change, the teams can easily adapt as sprints are short, and the subsequent sprints
planning can re-prioritise the changed requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sprints">
<h4>Sprints<a class="headerlink" href="#sprints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sprints are a short time-boxed period in which a scrum team endeavours to complete a set
amount of work. The duration of sprints can be determined by teams, but typically duration
is between 2-4 weeks. As sprints have several <a class="reference external" href="#scrum-ceremonies">ceremonies</a> that must be
completed, teams should determine what works best for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrum-roles">
<h4>Scrum Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#scrum-roles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Scrum teams have three key roles: product owner, scrum master, and development team members</p>
<div class="section" id="product-owner">
<h5>Product Owner<a class="headerlink" href="#product-owner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The product owner ensures the team delivers the most value to the client. They have a strong
understanding of the project, which is used to prioritise user stories in upcoming sprints.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/product_owner.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/roles">Atlassian</a></p>
<p>Product owners are required to maintain close ties with the client and
seek their validation and input. They are also the conduit for
communication with the client - all emails, meeting invites, etc. from
the team should be guided through the product owners to reach the
client.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrum-master">
<h5>Scrum Master<a class="headerlink" href="#scrum-master" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum framework is
followed. Unlike a manager, the scrum master coaches the team rather
than leading them - scrum masters are <strong>servant leaders</strong>. They have no
authority to act as a manager in the traditional sense of being able to
allocate tasks. Instead, it is their responsibility to ensure that they
oversee how the project is tracking, and work to unblock developers to
continue meeting objectives.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/scrum_master.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/roles">Atlassian</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development-team">
<h5>Development Team<a class="headerlink" href="#development-team" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The development team refers to the team members who are implementing the
system. In your project, <strong>all team members</strong> must be a part of the
development team (including the Scrum master and product owner).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/development_team.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/roles">Atlassian</a></p>
<p>There are several other roles that teams may benefit from using. Please
note that these are not Scrum roles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Quality Assurance/Testing lead: Monitors testing other initiatives
to ensure the system is built to a high quality. Often, they are
responsible for creating a testing plan and ensuring the testing
objectives are met</p></li>
<li><p>Frontend lead: Oversees the frontend development of the project and
is typically responsible for setting up and configuring the frontend
codebase. Additionally, plays a key role in any decision-making
about frontend architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Backend lead: Oversees the backend development of the project and is
typically responsible for setting up and configuring the backend
codebase. Additionally, plays a key role in any decision-making
about backend architecture.</p></li>

<p>We have outlined how the scrum framework can assist teams in following
the agile manifesto. Now we will discuss how development requirements
can be represented.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="representing-requirements-the-agile-way">
<h3>Representing Requirements the Agile Way<a class="headerlink" href="#representing-requirements-the-agile-way" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Product requirements are a way of defining a product’s purpose,
features, functionality, and behaviour. It serves as a common place to
develop and guide understanding for the technical team (the developers)
and the client to help build the product.</p>
<p>These requirements are then represented as initiatives, epics, tasks,
and subtasks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/requirements.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories">Atlassian</a></p>
<div class="section" id="initiatives">
<h4>Initiatives<a class="headerlink" href="#initiatives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this subject you will only have one concurrent project, so the
project will count as the initiative. In a larger business where there
might be 2 or more applications under development simultaneously, there
would be 2 or more initiatives to cover each development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="epics">
<h4>Epics<a class="headerlink" href="#epics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An epic refers to a large body of work that can be broken down into user
stories. Epics cluster user stories that have a similar higher-level
objective.</p>
<p>Epics are a useful way to organise and create a hierarchy out of the
work. The goal of breaking down epics into user stories is to reduce the
amount of work required for the project into small, incremental tasks so
that value is delivered throughout the life of the project through the
completion of these smaller tasks. For client-based projects, this means
that you can deliver incremental progress and demonstrate value much
easier than if the tasks remained large pieces of work.</p>
<p>Epics generally have a duration greater than one sprint. As the team
progresses through the project and develops a better understanding of
the project and its requirements, user stories will naturally be added
and removed from an epic. This is exactly what we want in an epic
following agile methodology: a flexible scope that changes based on
client feedback and team progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-stories">
<h4>User Stories<a class="headerlink" href="#user-stories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A user story is the smallest unit of work in the agile framework. A user
story may have one or many subtasks, but user stories are considered the
smallest piece of work that constitutes an end goal from a user’s
perspective. A user story is an end goal, not a feature, expressed from
the perspective of the software user.</p>
<p>As discussed, user stories refer to a way of writing requirements from
the perspective of the end-user. By doing this, requirements follow the
agile methodology and are focused on the value delivered to the
end-user.</p>
<p>A key component of agile software development is putting people first,
and a user story puts end-users at the centre of the conversation. User
stories use non-technical language to provide context for the
development team. From reading a user story, the developer doing the
work required for that user story knows what they are building, why they
are building, for whom they are building it, and what value it creates.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-write-a-user-story">
<h5>How to Write a User Story<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-write-a-user-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When first created, user stories consist of only one sentence in simple
language meant to outline the desired outcome - they don’t go into
detail. User stories are expanded upon later and more details are added
to the user story, as agreed by the team, as work begins on the issue.</p>
<p>User stories are written to be non-technical following the format:</p>
<p>As a [role], I want to [goal], so that I can [benefit].</p>
<p>As an example, a company like Facebook might create a user story for new
functionality for their website with the following format:<br />
<em>As an individual user, I want to upload a photo to my profile picture,
so that people who search for my name can see a photo of me.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="story-points-user-story-estimation-metric">
<h5>Story Points: User Story Estimation Metric<a class="headerlink" href="#story-points-user-story-estimation-metric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As user stories reflect requirements that a developer must implement,
they should have a corresponding estimate for the effort required to
develop the functionality. This is necessary for time-boxed projects to
estimate the time to delivery for new functionality. However,
estimations in the Agile world are not based on time, but instead use
<strong>story points</strong>.</p>
<p>Story points estimate a task by considering the amount of work that
needs to be done, the difficulty of the task and any potential risk or
uncertainty involved. This is a better estimate as using the time taken
to complete a task can vary from developer to developer depending on
their level of experience.</p>
<p>Various scales can be used for story points. Two common methods used
are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8…)</p></li>
<li><p>T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which estimation technique your team chooses to use, you
should have the estimation technique documented in your team’s document
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="estimation-process">
<h5>Estimation Process<a class="headerlink" href="#estimation-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The estimation process occurs during <a class="reference external" href="#scrum-ceremonies">sprint
planning</a>. There are several ways to estimate the
story points of a user story - we will look at planning poker today:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>All members are given cards that have a story point value. If using
Fibonacci sequence, would have cards for 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…</p></li>
<li><p>Product owner reads out a user story and clarifies details if anyone
has any questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Team discusses how they will handle the task and what skills are
required to understand the approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Each member picks a card with a story point value they feel matches
the user story just discussed, and places it face-down.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all team members have chosen a card, the team turns over all
the cards and discusses.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the team reaches a consensus on the user story’s estimate, the
product owner notes down the value.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until all user stories product owner has prepared are
complete.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The estimates should be added to your chosen task tracking tool.</p>

<div class="section" id="user-story-prioritisation">
<h5>User Story Prioritisation<a class="headerlink" href="#user-story-prioritisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>To deliver greater value to your client, you will want to invest your
efforts in tasks that are of importance first. The importance of tasks
is decided in discussions with the client (it <strong>is not</strong> up to the
development team to decide priority). One method of displaying the
priority of a task is the MoSCoW task prioritisation method. Priorities
are broken down into different levels of priority:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Must have:</em> features that must be delivered or the software will not
create the expected value for the client;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Should have:</em> features that have significant value to the client and
should be delivered, but not considered crucial;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Could have:</em> features that the client considers nice to have but will
not have a material impact to value, if not delivered; and</p></li>
<li><p><em>Won’t have:</em> out-of-scope features; useful as next steps for your
project as potential improvements for future releases.</p></li>

<h5>User Story Mapping<a class="headerlink" href="#user-story-mapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>User story maps are intended to spark collaboration across agile team members, while providing them
with the bigger picture of how the backlog stories fit together into a larger vision of the product your team
is building. In agile team, product work exists as discrete backlog tasks and so visual tools are extremely helpful
in communicating deadlines, goals, and the final product to developers in the team, as well as the client.
This guarantees everyone is working towards the same ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Once created, the Product Owner is responsible for driving the creationg of the user story map. However, it is
a group exercise and should be done by the entire team. Once created, it should then be communicated to the client.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Client Communications<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-2-client-communications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this subject, your team will be delivering a project to a client.
Most students are likely to only have had experience mostly with
university assignments and will be unfamiliar with how to interaction
with a client.</p>
<p>Your client will be assigned by the Subject Coordinator, and once your
client is assigned, you should contact them and work closely with them
throughout the semester.</p>
<p>You will need them to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Aid your team in developing requirements for your system.</p></li>
<li><p>Review progress after each sprint.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide feedback for prototypes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is imperative that you communicate all important product decisions
with your client and involve them by seeking their feedback.</p>
<p>Communication with the client takes place through the Product Owner -
they are the conduit of information between the team and the client, and
as such, will be responsible for emailing the client with updates,
invitations for meetings, etc.</p>

convenient time to conduct a first meeting.</p>
<p>To decide a common time to meet, you can use a scheduling tool, like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.when2meet.com">When2Meet</a>, to elicit their availability.</p>

<h4>Creating Meeting Invites<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-meeting-invites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once an available time has been decided with your client, the Product

your team and the client will not forget. Instructions on how to do this
can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Task Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-3-task-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Task tracking, also known as task management, is far more than a simple
to-do list. It means tracking tasks from beginning to end, delegating
subtasks to teammates, and setting deadlines to make sure projects are
done on time.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using task tracking software:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Centralise tasks, increasing team visibility of task progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise tasks as a team.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve collaboration, allowing any team member to work across any
task.</p></li>
<li><p>Track team progress.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed in agile methodology, task tracking is an important part of
representing requirements in an agile way.</p>
<p>In this subject, you are required to make use of a task tracking tool.
As a team, you will need to agree on a tool to use. There are a several
tools to choose from (this list is not exhaustive):</p>

<h3>Setting Up Your Team’s Task Management<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-your-team-s-task-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once your team has decided on a tool to use, the next step is to
populate it.</p>
<p>Regardless of your choice of task tracking tools, all require similar
set-ups and the same level of detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h4>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As discussed in agile methodology, all requirements of the system must
be translated into epics, user stories, subtasks, etc. in your chosen
task tracking tool.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Please see the chapter on requirements elicitation to understand how to elicit requirements from a client.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backlog">
<h4>Backlog<a class="headerlink" href="#backlog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The backlog contains all pieces of work for the semester. Any work
completed by the development team should have an associated task in the
tracking tool. At the beginning of the semester, the Product Owner
should populate the backlog with all requirements received from the
initial client meeting.</p>
<p>The backlog will look like this once populated:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/backlog.png" /></p>
<p>Once the backlog is populated, the Product Owner and client should
jointly determine the priority of each task. The priorities of tasks
help the development team determine what task to pick up next. It is
expected the development team will work on high priority tasks first
before moving on to lower priority tasks.</p>
<p>By default, all tasks are created with medium priority:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/priority_1.png" /></p>
<p>However, the priority can be changed to any of the below by editing the
task:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/priority_2.png" /></p>
<p>The priority of all user stories in the backlog should reflect the
prioritisation given by the client (please see the chapter on
requirements elicitation).</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, the development team then uses the backlog
as its single source of truth for work, and as the project progresses,
work should be added and removed from the backlog.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflow">
<h4>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As a team, you should have a defined flow that all work must follow. A
workflow covers all steps that must be done for work to be considered
“ready for development” and then subsequently “ready for review” and
then “complete”. Creating a workflow ensures that all team members
understand and follow the same process, thus ensuring a high quality of
work completed with far less oversight necessary. As workload increases,
having a defined workflow ensures that the team’s processes are
scalable.</p>
<div class="section" id="defining-a-workflow">
<h5>Defining a Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-a-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When defining a workflow, it can be tempting to make it complicated -
avoid this temptation. Most important when creating a workflow is that
it is understood by the team and highly repeatable.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>All tasks that are created are first created in the backlog. Tasks
that are selected for development are then moved into the upcoming
sprint.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a developer commences work on an issue, the issue is moved to
the next status.</p></li>
<li><p>Once development work has finished, the task should be moved to the
next status for review by teammate(s). The task must be reviewed by
another team member (not the one who completed the work).</p></li>
<li><p>If the review passes successfully (no bugs are found), the task
should be moved to a completed status. If it fails review, it should
be moved backwards to the prior status so the developer can address
the bugs found.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example-workflow">
<h5>An Example Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The following is just one example of a workflow, and you are welcome to
define your own that best suits your team - this is by no means the best
workflow.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/workflow1.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/workflow">Atlassian</a></p>
<p>Status: Open</p>
<p>This is the status that is assigned to all newly created tasks in the
current sprint. For a task to be able to be moved from status open to in
progress, it must have a definition of ready (DoR). A task with a
definition of ready means it can be picked up by any developer and that
developer can begin work immediately.</p>
<p>It is up to your team to decide on the definition of ready, however, a
few examples of what might be required for a task to be considered ready
for development can include (but is not limited to) the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The story should be written exactly in the ‘user story’ format and
added to the User Stories page in the document repository. If it is
not a user story, then it does not need to follow this format nor be
added to the document repository.</p></li>
<li><p>The story should be created in the appropriate epic in the task
tracking tool and added to the backlog.</p></li>
<li><p>It must have acceptance criteria written and added to the Acceptance
Criteria page in the team’s document repository.</p></li>
<li><p>The acceptance criteria must be understood and agreed to by the team
<em>(we will discuss the acceptance criteria in status: in progress
below)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The team must estimate the story during a sprint planning meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The task must have an assignee.</p></li>
<li><p>The task must have a due date.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following is an example of a well populated user story in Jira. It
has a title in the form of a user story, acceptance criteria, priority,
and, as it is still open, it is correctly still in the backlog.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/story_open.png" /></p>
<p>Status: In Progress</p>
<p>This status indicates that development work has commenced. For a task to
be properly in progress, it must abide by the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>It should have a single assignee. If more than one developer is
completing the work, then the task is too big, and should be broken
down into smaller, iterative tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>It should have an estimation of story points.</p></li>
<li><p>It should have a deadline when development is expected to be
completed.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be contained in a sprint.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following is an example of a well populated user story in Jira. It
has a title in the form of a user story, acceptance criteria, priority,
assignee, due date, and, as the story is in progress, it is assigned to
the current sprint.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/story_in_progress.png" /></p>
<p>Status: In Review</p>
<p>There are several methods that can be used to review work done
by team members.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Manual review: reviewers pick up tasks that have status: in review
and review the code manually. This involves reading the code
line-by-line, running tests, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer programming: Two or more developers work together on a task,
then one commits the code, and the other developers approve the code
as reviewed. This is by far the fastest way to review work and
recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Walkthrough: As a substitute for the regular review process, a
developer can walk through their task with other teammates as part
of a collaborative process where teammates can ask questions. The
whole team is not required to be present - your team should decide
on a quorum required to receive approval.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following is an example of a well populated user story in Jira. It
has a title in the form of a user story, acceptance criteria, priority,
assignee, reviewer, due date, and, as the story is in review, it is
assigned to the current sprint.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/story_in_review.png" /></p>
<p>Status: Done</p>
<p>As well as a definition of ready, the team should have a definition of
done (DoD). The definition of done stipulates what is required before a
task can be moved to status: done.</p>
<p>It is up to your team to decide on the definition of done, however, a
few examples of what might be required for a task to be considered done
can include (but is not limited to) the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Code is peer-reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>Code is commented.</p></li>
<li><p>Code is checked in to trunk.</p></li>
<li><p>Code is deployed to test environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Code passes all testing listed in the team’s document repository.</p></li>
<li><p>End-user documentation is updated (for example, how-to guides).</p></li>
<li><p>Code is live on the production server.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following is an example of a well populated user story in Jira. It
has a title in the form of a user story, acceptance criteria, priority,
assignee, reviewer, due date, and, as the story is complete, it is
assigned to the current sprint. It also has comments from the reviewer
showing the task was reviewed with no issues found.</p>

<div class="section" id="good-hygiene">
<h4>Good Hygiene<a class="headerlink" href="#good-hygiene" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Task tracking tools are common spaces shared by the entire team. They
are where teammates go to understand the status of an issue or what to
work on next, supervisors use it to monitor team progress, product
owners use it to communicate progress to the client, etc. It is
therefore imperative that they are kept in good shape:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure that issues are updated frequently as coding continues.</p></li>
<li><p>Add comments to describe the status of an issue as you progress it.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the deadline if it is pushed back- or forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the issue between statuses as necessary.</p></li>

<h2>Chapter 4: Document Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-4-document-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the semester, you and your team will generate a lot of
knowledge - in the form of software requirements, architecture, and
testing documents, etc. This knowledge will need to be centrally stored
so it is accessible to the entire team and to the client at handover.</p>
<p>Document repositories solve this issue by acting as a central store of
all project information and should be the first place your team
references when searching for information.</p>
<p>There are many options for document repository software, but in this
subject, we strongly encourage the use of Confluence.</p>
<p>Confluence is the industry leader and is a good tool to familiarise
yourself with, if you wish to work as a software engineer as most
companies use it.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-your-team-s-space">
<h3>Creating Your Team’s Space<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-team-s-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step is to create your team’s Confluence space. Only one team
member needs to do this and then grant every other team member access.</p>
<p>To set up the space, please follow these instructions: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFF4D4I19ms&amp;t=259s">Creating a space
in Confluence</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-up-your-space">
<h3>Set Up Your Space<a class="headerlink" href="#set-up-your-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once created, it is very important to structure your space in a way that
makes it easy to navigate.</p>
<p>You can begin by setting up your home page. The home page should
contain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Project summary.</p></li>
<li><p>Details of the client, supervisor, and development team.</p></li>
<li><p>Important links to other tools, for example, links to task tracking,
code repository, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/home_page.png" /></p>
<p>Once the home page is set up, the next pages to create are meeting
pages. Over the semester, you will be required to hold team, client, and
supervisor meetings and you are expected to keep minutes for all
meetings.</p>
<p>So, one logical way of structuring the Confluence space could be:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/meetings.png" /></p>
<p>There should be a relative frequency of meetings. Supervisor meetings
should occur weekly, team meetings should occur a few times each week,
and client meetings should occur every few weeks. It is very important
you create a log of each meeting:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/meeting_structure.png" /></p>
<p>In the meeting page itself, your team should log:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Agenda, so teammates can create questions in advance of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants present during the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A video and audio recording of the meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>All discussion items and decisions reached.</p></li>
<li><p>All action items with an assigned teammate who is responsible for
the action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/meeting_page.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Throughout the semester you will be developing a
lot of resources that will need to be stored in Confluence. Please make
sure you put thought into the structure of your space. If a teammate is
unable to find work, it may result in duplication of tasks. If the
client or marker is unable to find work, they may believe you have not
done it.</p>

<h4>Branching<a class="headerlink" href="#branching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Git branches are effectively pointers to your self-contained changes.
When you, as a developer, want to make changes to the code of a project
in a remote repository (no matter how big or small the change is), you
will create a branch to encapsulate all your changes. That branch is
entirely self-contained and is not a part of the remote repository’s
code. This stops potentially unstable code from being committed to the
repository before it can be thoroughly tested and properly merged.</p>

<div class="section" id="example-git-workflow">
<h4>Example Git Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#example-git-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><em>Bringing everything we have discussed together</em>.</p>
<p>Once you have cloned (downloaded the most recent copy of the codebase)
from GitHub. You have what is called a <em>local copy</em> of the repository.</p>
<p>Then, any changes you make within your working directory (copy of the
repository on your machine) is said to be untracked. This means Git does
not know about the file and its changes.</p>
<p>To ensure git tracks the file and its history, you need to add the file
using the command git add [filename].</p>
<p>Once a file is tracked, its changes fall under two categories: staged or
unstaged. For unstaged changes, Git has not marked the file to be a part
of the subsequent commit. Staged changes refer to files with changes
that are to be added to the next commit. When making a change that you
want to be added to the remote copy of the repository, you need to make
sure the changes are staged. This can be done by using the command git
add [filename].</p>
<p>When all your changes are staged, then you want to commit those changes.
A commit is a snapshot/milestone with a series of changes. Commits can
be created with a message, using the following command: git commit -m
“commit message”.</p>
<p>Once a commit is made, the file goes back to the unmodified state as the
local repository updates the current branch’s history with the latest
changes. To ensure the remote repository is also updated, such that
everyone in the team can see the changes made, you need to push the
changes to the remote repository. This can be done by running git push.</p>
<p>Another developer who may want to see your changes, can pull changes by
running the command git pull [remote] [branch]. This will fetch the
latest changes from the remote repository and integrate them with their
local files.</p>

<h3>Configuring Your Team’s Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-your-team-s-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your first task once you decide to use GitHub is to set up a repository.
You can learn how to do that
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have created a repository, there are several considerations
when establishing how your team will work with the repository.</p>
<div class="section" id="readme">
<h4>README<a class="headerlink" href="#readme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>All teams should have a project level README file that explains your
project, and what your system aims to do. It should also provide some
detail as to how to use your code, along with any other useful
information (the directory structure could be useful for complex file
structures).</p>
<p>Teams can also add README files for separate components of the project,
such as frontend and backend, which may detail specific
commands/instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="licenses">
<h4>Licenses<a class="headerlink" href="#licenses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you are creating a repository with the intention of making it
publicly accessible eventually, you need to have a license to allow
other developers to collaborate (and to protect you from misuse). GitHub
provides a
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository">detailed guide on licenses</a>
along with a tool to determine which license is appropriate for your
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="branch-protection">
<h4>Branch Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-protection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When working on a software project, you want to ensure that critical
branches (production branches) are not accidentally tampered with or
deleted. Branch protection helps solve this by allowing developers to
configure their repository such that key branches have certain
protections that prevent deletions or require certain checks to pass
before modifications. Such branches are called <strong>protected branches</strong>.</p>

<p>Pull requests allow developers to review changes made on a certain
branch before merging it into another. When team members complete some
functionality and want it to be merged, they create a pull request,
requesting for their changes to be pulled into the main branch.
Developers can nominate reviewers to look at their pull request.
Reviewers can inspect the code and either approve the changes, or
request changes. Once approved, the developer can merge their code into
the main branch.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Team members must review and check that the code changes are
acceptable, thereby improving code quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Errors have a greater chance of being noticed early, as there is
more than one team member reviewing/testing the changes.</p></li>
<li><p>They improve the team’s understanding of code as developers are
forced to read other developers’ code; thereby dispersing knowledge
of the code’s functionality more widely across the team.</p></li>

<h5>Pull Request Templates<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-request-templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ensuring your pull request has enough detail for a reviewer is crucial.
If the reviewer does not understand what part of functionality has been
added, they cannot provide a meaningful review. To avoid this, a pull
request template can be useful. This provides a guideline on what
information a developer should provide in the pull request, along with
any mandatory checks that have already been completed.</p>

<h3>Git Workflows (Branching Strategies)<a class="headerlink" href="#git-workflows-branching-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A standard approach to organising Git actions within the project. Let us
consider two common strategies…</p>
<div class="section" id="feature-branching">
<h4>Feature Branching<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-branching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Feature branching entails creating a new branch for a new feature and
using that same branch until the feature is completed. After completion,
the feature branch is merged back into the main branch.</p>
<p><img alt="Feature branching diagram" src="../_images/feature_development.png" /></p>
<p><em>Source:</em>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/trunk-based-development/">Optimizely</a></p>
<p>There are several flavours of feature branching but we will examine
Gitflow, by far one of the most popular branching strategies.</p>
<div class="section" id="gitflow">
<h5>Gitflow<a class="headerlink" href="#gitflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Gitflow relies on long-lived branches for development. There are two
main branches, main and develop, with main being the production-ready
codebase and develop reflecting changes to be made in the next release.
Developers create feature branches off develop, and when complete,
developers make a pull request to be merged into the develop branch.
When the team is ready for a release, then a new branch is created and
the code is tested before it is merged into the main branch.</p>

<h3>Software Releases<a class="headerlink" href="#software-releases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When your team has completed a sprint or wants to make a new release,
there are several steps you should complete.</p>
<p>Releases are comprised of a tag and release notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h3>Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GitHub allows developers to create tags. These provide teams to mark key
milestones in a project by creating a tag off a certain commit. Tags are
useful in releases, and you can name a tag by the associated version
number, and that way developers can easily find all previous versions of
the production-ready software by looking at the tags.</p>
<p>Tags are also necessary when creating software that is not yet
production ready when working for a client. They need to be able to
access the work completed in a sprint to see changes, but if the
application is not yet live, then a tag is used to update the client on
project status.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-notes">
<h3>Release Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#release-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you are creating multiple releases, it is important to explain what
key changes have been made to the product. In a commercial project,
release notes inform users of changes and clearly indicate the incentive
to upgrade to the latest version (for example, patching authentication
security bugs is a good incentive for users to migrate to the latest
version of a product). In your project, the release notes provide an
appropriate level of detail for your client to understand exactly what
features and capabilities are available in each release.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Requirements Elicitation<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-8-requirements-elicitation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Successful products are those that meet the needs of the client and can
be easily adopted by the target user. Building a successful product can
be difficult if teams do not understand the core business need of the
product itself.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to understand more about requirements
elicitation, the broad spectrum of tasks involved to help teams derive
their requirements. By the end of this, you should understand what
artefacts are used to represent the project specifications.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-requirements">
<h3>What Are Requirements?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before we look at how requirements elicitation works, let us consider
what requirements are. Broadly speaking, requirements define what teams
need to implement. There are three key types of requirements that are
used in software projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Functional requirements: These stipulate what the system should do.
The Agile Scrum framework expresses functional requirements as user
stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-functional requirements: These requirements detail any
additional constraints that specify how a system should behave. Some
examples include any safety, security, or performance requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Emotional requirements: Requirements that detail how the target user
should feel when interacting with the system.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-do-we-need-to-perform-requirements-elicitation">
<h3>Why Do We Need to Perform Requirements Elicitation?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-to-perform-requirements-elicitation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Teams are provided with a high-level project brief and are tasked with
extracting the project requirements. Requirements elicitation helps
teams understand what these requirements are, whilst also building a
strong understanding of the project and why it is needed.</p>
<p>Requirements are important as they provide teams with a clear set of
features that the team will work to complete. It is also a clear way of
demonstrating to the client, what capabilities will be delivered.</p>
<p>A strong understanding of the business need is equally important. As
clients may often not know exactly what they want, a strong
understanding of the project is important. When teams can understand
what the key frustrations are, they are well positioned to come up with
solutions that successfully solve the client’s pain points.</p>
<p>The process of requirements engineering, which is simply all the
activities required to have your detailed specifications, are discussed
below.</p>
<div class="section" id="background-research">
<h4>0. Background Research<a class="headerlink" href="#background-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before you speak to your client, you should develop a general
understanding of the project to aid your team in directing the meeting
and forming helpful questions. For example, a previous year was tasked
with building a personal CRM for clients. It was important for all
students to have a good understanding of what a CRM was prior to the
initial meeting.</p>
<p>Additionally, teams will benefit from finding competitors within the
problem domain, to look for potential functionality that the client may
want. Understanding the client’s competitors, peers, etc. will save the
client work in having to explain all facets of their business and
industry to your team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-client-meeting-and-elicitation">
<h4>1. Initial Client Meeting and Elicitation<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-client-meeting-and-elicitation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="section" id="client-meeting">
<h5>Client Meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#client-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The first client meeting is your chance to understand more about your
client, the project, and their expectations. During this meeting, teams
should try to establish a basic understanding of the problem.
Understanding what is wrong or missing with the current system (system
as is) is critical in making sure that you build a product that can
solve these frustrations/problems. If possible, teams should also
clarify exactly what is expected from the product: who will use this,
should the product be a mobile application or website, what other
preferences should be considered.</p>
<p>Make sure to schedule the meeting in advance and prepare an agenda of
questions you would like to ask ahead of time. Emailing your client with
the agenda can be beneficial to ensure they are prepared. The meeting
itself should have a facilitator and note taker assigned ahead of time,
with team members jumping in as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="elicitation">
<h5>Elicitation<a class="headerlink" href="#elicitation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Following your initial meeting, the team should work through the meeting
minutes to extract the key requirements. Teams should work to extract
the user goals - the objectives the target user of the system would want
to achieve. These correlate to user stories, an agile way of
representing requirements (see Agile methodology). Additionally, while
you are in the process of reaching this shared understanding of what
should be achieved, teams should also clearly look to define what the
scope is. If there were any features or functionality mentioned earlier
by the client, that cannot be feasibly achieved, then these should be
clearly identified.</p>
<p>The process of writing your requirements can be done by different
methods.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivational-modelling">
<h6>Motivational Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#motivational-modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>One popular technique is to use motivational modelling. This technique
allows the functional, non-functional, and emotional goals of the system
to represented in a diagram. The benefit is that diagrams are often
easier to read compared to written requirements, and emotional
requirements are also considered.</p>
<p>Motivational modelling is done through brainstorming a list of the key
requirements of the system and stakeholders involved. The list is called
a DO/BE/FEEL/WHO list, and should detail:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DO: what your system can do? (Functional goals)</p></li>
<li><p>BE: how your system should behave? (Non-functional goals)</p></li>
<li><p>FEEL: how users should feel when using the system? (Emotional goals)</p></li>
<li><p>WHO: key stakeholders</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is then converted into a hierarchical diagram, as shown below.
This is a great starting point for teams to confirm the understanding of
the project requirements, with the bottom leaves corresponding to user
stories.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="elaboration">
<h4>2. Elaboration<a class="headerlink" href="#elaboration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once the general user goals are understood, teams should work to expand
and refine the information collected. This typically involves:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verifying the motivational model is consistent with the clients
understanding and expanding as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing personas to match your target users.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing prototypes.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="personas">
<h5>Personas<a class="headerlink" href="#personas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Personas refer to fictional characters that represent the different
types of users that may use your product. They play a key role in
helping teams empathise and understand the users of the product, through
using the persona to establish whether certain design decisions are
correct.</p>
<p>To understand the power of a persona, consider buying a car. Different
people buy cars for different reasons. Some people are looking for a
large, reliable car for transporting their families whereas other people
look for fast and luxurious cars to fit their lifestyles. If you had to
design a car for a person, it is important to understand which category
your client falls in, to make sure the car you design is suited to their
purpose. This is how personas can be useful.</p>

<p><em>Source:</em>
<a class="reference external" href="https://99designs.com.au/blog/business/how-to-create-user-personas/">99Designs</a></p>
<p>It might seem weird to use fictional characters but using real people
(like your client, a team member, etc.) could result in data privacy
breaches, as well as unrealistic use cases, if they are not well aligned
to actual user requirements.</p>
<div class="section" id="writing-personas">
<h6>Writing Personas<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-personas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>A persona should have the following elements:</p>

<li><p>Job title/responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Demographics (age, education).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="prototypes">
<h5>Prototypes<a class="headerlink" href="#prototypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Coding a system can be complex, and time-consuming. If your client
realises they do not like the design of the system, or perhaps some
interface needs to be reworked, doing this on the actual system can be
incredibly time-consuming. Like many projects, one of the key
constraints of your project is time. As a result, simply coding the
system after deriving your requirements increases the risk of having to
make major changes to the system midway.</p>
<p>Prototypes provide a solution to this problem. Teams can build a
prototype, a hand drawn or digital mock system that resembles what the
final product should look or behave like. These are much quicker to
build and allow teams to get feedback from the client much earlier,
reducing the likelihood of major changes to the system’s interface
later.</p>
<div class="section" id="classes-of-prototypes">
<h6>Classes of Prototypes<a class="headerlink" href="#classes-of-prototypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Paper prototype/Low fidelity prototype</em>: Hand drawing of user
interface to allow it to be rapidly designed, simulated, and tested.
These are typically black and white and don’t consider choices such as
colour palette, font, and general styling.</p></li>
<li><p><em>High fidelity prototype</em>: A digital prototype that looks very similar
to what the final product should look like. These prototypes are made
using no-code programs and should determine the final design of the
system.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="building-a-low-fidelity-prototype">
<h7>Building a Low Fidelity Prototype<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-low-fidelity-prototype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h7>
<p>There are many tools that can be used for creating low fidelity
prototypes:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Microsoft PowerPoint: While sometimes slow and cumbersome,
PowerPoint comes complete with several good features for drawing and
designing UI elements. <img alt="" src="../_images/low_fidelity_prototype.png" /> <em>This is an example of a watch UI

<h7>Building a High-Fidelity Prototype<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-high-fidelity-prototype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h7>
<p>The benefit of using a high-fidelity prototype vs. a low fidelity
prototype is it allows development teams to be much more specific about
how a product will look, feel, and act without having to code it (which
can be very time-consuming). High fidelity prototypes also allow for
greater interactivity - it can be demonstrated to the client and other
users, and they can interact with the prototype to click buttons, menus,
view page transitions, etc. to gain a much better idea of how the final
product will behave. This is a great way of eliciting very specific
feedback from the client on the placement of buttons, uses of colours,
etc.</p>

<h4>3. Negotiation, Validation, and Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#negotiation-validation-and-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As the various requirements artefacts are developed, teams should be
validating these with the client. If there is some disagreement between
what the team believes is achievable and what the client wants, teams
are required to negotiate and reconcile any differences. In extreme
cases where a resolution cannot be reached, speak to your supervisor.</p>
<p>Running usability tests with your client is the easiest way to validate
the requirements your team has created. First, a team should create
tasks that can be completed using the prototypes - these tasks will
represent the full set or a subset of the user stories. For example, if
a user story is that a user logs in and views their purchase, the
high-fidelity prototype should permit users to simulate this user story.
It should have a success narrative and all other narratives should be
failures.</p>
<p>If a user can successfully log in and view their purchase history, this
is the success narrative. If they cannot, the task has been failed.</p>
<p>Once these tasks have been created, your team should contact the client
to organise a meeting to conduct testing. Your team should assign a test
facilitator whose job it is to ask the participant (your client) to
perform the tasks your team has created. While the participant completes
each task, the facilitator observes the participant’s behaviour and
listens for feedback.</p>
<p>A minute taker should be assigned to note down feedback - all feedback
should be welcomed from the client for things as small as the colour of
a button. The more feedback you can elicit at this stage, the more time
it will save you later when you have to make much more time-consuming
changes to code.</p>
<p>One tool that can automate this process for you is
<a class="reference external" href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041246514-Test-your-Figma-prototypes-with-Maze">Maze</a>.
These tools typically exist with all high-fidelity prototypes listed
above.</p>
<p>Finally, once all your requirements have been finalised and the client
is happy with them, you will have your set of specifications. This
should include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>User stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivational model.</p></li>
<li><p>Personas.</p></li>

<p>Software architecture is the fundamental organisation of the system
under development. It includes all components, their interactions, the
environment in which they operate, and the principles used to design the
software.</p>
<p>Once the application’s stack is chosen, it is important to outline the
architecture of the system. Detailing the architecture serves the
purpose of assuring the client that the development team has thought
through the interactions of components and the principles that
underpinned their development. It is required information to handover to
the client at the end of semester, so they can continue development.</p>

<p>There are many ways of documenting the architecture of software - the
one we will teach is the 4+1 architecture model.</p>
<p>It was originally developed in the 1990s and is used to describe the
architecture using several, concurrent views. End-users, developers,
system engineers, and project managers all have unique views of the
system, hence the viewpoints are used to describe it from their
perspectives.</p>
<p>There are five views in the 4+1 view model:</p>

<p>There are two teams that are core to delivering functional software:</p>

<li><p><em>Operations teams:</em> manage the change management, security,
deployment, monitoring, and feedback.</p></li>

<p>The development and operations teams previously worked in isolation -
the developer team worked on the product while the operations team
handled the release. This led to a lot of problems when it came to when
it came to integrate code and manage the release.</p>

<p>CI/CD refers to continuous integration and continuous

deliver software to a production environment without having to rely on
cumbersome manual processes. Through automating parts of the release
process, CI/CD allows developers to make quicker releases.</p>

<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Fast: the time taken for releases are significantly reduced through

<h3>DevOps Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#devops-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Teams should use CI/CD within their projects, using either continuous
delivery or deployment. CI/CD is achieved using pipelines.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-your-pipeline">
<h4>Creating Your Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Pipelines refer to a set of steps executed when some condition is met.
Often, teams will customise their pipelines to be triggered on pull
requests. This means, when a developer creates a pull request to merge
code changes from their branch to the main branch, the pipeline will
automatically run the set of steps specified.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, developers perform several checks before merging any code.
You want to make sure your project builds successfully, the code follows
any formatting conventions, and that all the test cases written still
pass. When creating your pipeline, these kinds of checks are written as
steps that you want to be executed on your given condition. As such,
teams should ensure that when they create their pipeline, they should
include the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>install dependencies and build</p></li>
<li><p>format</p></li>
<li><p>run</p></li>
<li><p>test</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example-ci-cd-workflow">
<h4>An Example CI/CD Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example-ci-cd-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Let us consider an example of how this may look. Once you have your
pipeline, the workflow is simple. Consider the case where your pipeline
is triggered on pull requests. A team member makes a pull request from
their own branch, dev/authentication, into the main branch, main. This
will trigger the pipeline to execute, and it will sequentially build,
format, run, and test as stipulated in the pipeline. If any step fails,
it will indicate which step failed and developers can even inspect the
logs to find why.</p>
<p>Once all the steps successfully complete, the pipeline will indicate
that the code has passed all its checks. This will then allow other
developers to review the code themselves, before approving the pull
request. Once the code is accepted, a developer can merge the code from
dev/authentication into main. From here, you can either have a separate
pipeline set up to handle the deployment process or allow your
deployment provider to deploy from the main branch.</p>
<p>This workflow is shown below:</p>

<h4>Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Unit testing is completed during the development of an application and
is completed by the developers. When a developer picks up a task from
the task tracking tool, they are expected to implement the task as
required and prove that the unit of work does what they say it does.
This is where unit testing comes in.</p>
<p>Unit tests isolate a section of code to verify correctness. A unit may
be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.</p>
<div class="section" id="reasons-to-complete-unit-testing">
<h5>Reasons to Complete Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#reasons-to-complete-unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle when it
is less expensive and easier to locate bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Good unit tests serve as project documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit tests permit code re-use - if you know a component you have
created is thoroughly tested and works well, you can introduce it
into other parts of your application’s codebase without being
concerned it will cause issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a tension that exists in software testing between available
time to implement a task and time that should be spent on testing each
task. Many developers cut down on testing time to complete more work.
This is a myth that you can somehow minimise time spent testing and end
up with a fully functional and bug-free piece of software.</p>
<p>It in fact saves time unit testing tasks as they are completed. They are
easy to isolate - introducing a buggy component into a larger piece of
work is akin to finding a needle in a haystack when bugs arise later
(and bugs will arise later, if you have not tested them).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="types-of-unit-testing">
<h5>Types of Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>There are two primary types of unit testing: manual and automated.</p>
<div class="section" id="manual-unit-testing">
<h6>Manual Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>As the name suggests, this involves manually testing a unit of work.
This is normally done by the developer who completed the work and
involves creating documentation detailing the step-by-step instructions
(with screenshots and comments) showing the success scenarios of the
unit, as well as any failure scenarios.</p>
<p>This documentation should be tested and confirmed by a reviewer (another
member of the development team).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automated-unit-testing">
<h6>Automated Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>There are several tools that can be used to automate unit testing
(depending on the language chosen for your project). Some examples are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>: a popular and free
testing tool for Java.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jestjs.io">Jest</a>: a popular and free testing

</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="integration-testing">
<h4>Integration Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Integration testing involves integrating software modules and testing
them as a group.</p>
<p>You might wonder why integration testing is necessary when all tasks
have (hopefully) been unit tested:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A unit is designed by one developer whose understanding and
programming logic may differ from other developers. Integration
testing verifies that software modules work in unity regardless of
which developer developed the module.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes of requirements by the clients could mean some modules are
outdated and need to be tested and integrated carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>Calls and return statements between software modules and the
database, hosting service, etc. could be erroneous.</p></li>
<li><p>Exception handling between components could be lacking.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Integration testing differs from other tests as it primarily focuses on
information and data flow between modules. The emphasis is on
integrating links between modules.</p>
<p>As an example, you might have two modules:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Authentication component</p></li>
<li><p>Email component.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both modules work as expected when conducting unit testing, but now the
team must test that information flows from authentication to the email
module. An example test case might be:</p>
<table class="colwidths-auto docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Test Case ID</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Objective</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Description</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Expected Result</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>Test the link between the authentication and email modules.</p></td>
<td><p>Enter login and credentials and click login button.</p></td>
<td><p>User should be successfully redirected to the email module.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is just one example of testing the integration between two
components - when conducting actual integration testing, there would
likely be many more tests.</p>

<div class="section" id="acceptance-testing">
<h4>Acceptance Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#acceptance-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Acceptance testing tests whether the system meets the requirements as
specified by the client - it tests whether the system passes or fails a
given user story.</p>
<p>Often, the process of acceptance testing begins during the requirements
phase. Teams write acceptance criteria to describe a pass/fail set of
criteria that is used to determine whether a user story is completed.
Acceptance criteria do not care about how you implement the
functionality.</p>
<p>Once you have your acceptance criteria, you can use this to write test
cases that are used to verify the result of the criteria (acceptance
tests).</p>
<div class="section" id="acceptance-criteria-template">
<h5>Acceptance Criteria Template<a class="headerlink" href="#acceptance-criteria-template" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

<div class="section" id="code-coverage">
<h3>Code Coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#code-coverage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A common metric for thoroughness of your test plan is code coverage. It
examines what proportion of code is covered by a test. While code
coverage is not an indicator of success (i.e., coverage scores of 100%
does not necessarily mean you have tested the right things), it is a
good indicator of test extensiveness. Code coverage score greater than
80% is generally considered sufficient.</p>
<p>Code coverage works by testing many or all the below:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Function coverage:</em> how many of the functions defined have been
called.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Statement coverage:</em> how many of the statements in the program have
been executed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Branches coverage:</em> how many of the branches of the control
structures (if statements for instance) have been executed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Condition coverage:</em> how many of the Boolean sub-expressions have
been tested for a true and a false value.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Line coverage:</em> how many of lines of source code have been tested.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Code coverage reports are created in the process by tools (detailed
below) and are displayed:</p>

<h3>During the Demonstration<a class="headerlink" href="#during-the-demonstration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Develop tasks and use personas to complete the tasks:</em> Teams are
required to demonstrate their application during their presentation.
We recommend walking through your application as if you were the
target user. Employing personas can help make the presentation more
engaging.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demonstrate high value features</em>: As you decide what features to
showcase, remember that you should show the functionality that is of
high value to your client. You need to show how the application you
built meets your client’s expectations. Activities such as
authentication can be omitted as it rarely is a specific requirement
from the client. You can use the user stories priorities to decide
what is of high value to the client.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use realistic data:</em> When demonstrating, it is important to use
realistic data where possible. You are trying to show how a
real-life customer would use the application, and so the data should
be realistic, too. We recommend teams to have their mock data
written or saved somewhere so the demonstrator knows exactly what to
use.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Preparing for failure is also important as things can go wrong
during a demonstration.</em> Sometimes the application may not be
predictable, or you may discover a bug mid-demonstration. Practicing
can help reduce the likelihood of this occurring, but teams should
still have a plan for what to do in case of failure. Having an
authenticated session ready as a backup can be useful, or having
another student stand-by to take-over, if one student is having
issues.</p></li>

<li><p>Have a practice run through on the day.</p></li>

<h3>Hubspot - Make My Persona<a class="headerlink" href="#hubspot-make-my-persona" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Firstly, you do NOT need a Hubspot account to use this tool. Visit
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona">this link</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you click the “Build My Persona” button, it will take you through a 7-steps tour to create your persona.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, you can just choose to skip walkthrough mode and edit it yourself.
<img alt="Landing page of Make My Persona" src="../_images/MakeMyPersona1.jpg" /> <img alt="Take tour or skip" src="../_images/MakeMyPersona2.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Either way, you will get the chance to edit/add/delete sections at the end.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="save-and-export">
<h4>Save and Export<a class="headerlink" href="#save-and-export" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Yes - you can save this persona and edit it later. What you do is:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Once you finish the 7-steps tour, or you have chosen the option to skip the tour, you will arrive at a
“Make My Persona Overview” page.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the save button.
<img alt="Click the save button" src="../_images/MakeMyPersona3.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>It will ask you to fill in some personal details.</p></li>
<li><p>After you have filled in your personal details, click the “Download Now” button.
<img alt="Procedure to save" src="../_images/MakeMyPersona4.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>You can download your persona as a PDF. You will also be given a link that you can use to access it in the

<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Sign up for free on <a class="reference external" href="https://miro.com/">Miro website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have signed up, Miro will let you set up your team. (Note: If you use your university student
email address to sign up, you might notice that there are some teams that you can join in your organisation
already - but that’s not what we need. In this subject, you will need to create your own project team. )

<p>Frame can help you organise your board, especially if you run out of boards and decide to put multiple diagrams in
one board. Also, if you want to export your board to a PDF, it is essential that you put content inside a frame
(each frame will be a single page on the PDF).</p>
<p><strong>How to add a frame:</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>On the tool bar, select the frame icon (marked in red).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you can select the desired frame dimention. In this example, let us select “custom”.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Miro5.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Ajust the size of the frame so that your artefact is completely covered in the frame, as shown in the image

<h2>Appendix E: Marvel Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-e-marvel-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial shows you how you can use Marvel to help you create your paper prototype.</p>
<div class="section" id="before-you-start-prototyping">
<h3>Before You Start Prototyping<a class="headerlink" href="#before-you-start-prototyping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before you start prototyping, let us remind ourselves - why are we creating paper prototypes?  What’s the purpose
again?</p>
<p>The purpose of creating paper prototypes is to design the user interfaces of the system-to-be so that you can run
usability test with end-users and clients to make sure it is fit for purpose. If you discover any problem during
usability testing, you can go back and modify your design.  By the end of the process, you have a validated
prototype before you start coding.  Improving design on your prototype is probably going to be much less expansive
than on your code.</p>
<p>Now that you are clear on the purpose behind the task, we would like to provide some advice to help you:</p>
<div class="section" id="no-1-completeness-of-scenarios">
<h4>No.1: Completeness of Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#no-1-completeness-of-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>During your usability test, you will have tasks for your users/clients to perform. It’s really important to make
sure that these scenarios in your paper prototype are complete. What does that mean? Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a scenario where a user needs to book a hotel room.  On the interface, you have an option to
confirm or cancel. You made sure that the “Confirm” button is clickable, and you prepared the transition to the
next page.  But the “Cancel” button is non-clickable. During the usability test, your client clicks “Cancel” and
nothing happens.</p>
<p>The example above is an <strong>incomplete</strong> scenario. <strong>It’s better to have 4 - 5 complete scenarios than creating 100
pages but a lot of buttons are non-clickable</strong>.  Remember - you want to run usability test and observe your users
interacting with the system to improve your design. Half-completed scenarios won’t help you with that - it will even
create confusions for users/clients. If you are designing a large system and there are a LOT of user stories to
cover, we advise you to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Ask yourself: what are the most important things that users must be able to accomplish on the application?
What user stories MUST be tested?</p></li>
<li><p>Select 4 - 5 user stories or scenarios from your list, and start prototyping. Make sure they are complete.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>No.2: Don’t Give the Answer Away<a class="headerlink" href="#no-2-don-t-give-the-answer-away" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Let’s use our booking hotel room example again. Make sure you don’t give away clues or describe the steps to your
users. Don’t say “First you would login, then you would click the Find Destination button, then you would browse
all the hotels available, then…” the instructions that you give will prevent you from discovering design flaws.
Instead, set up a little scenario for your users, provide them with context and observe how they complete the
activity. For example, a better task would be:</p>
<p><em>You are planning a trip with your family to Sydney from 24th December - 2nd January. You want to book a hotel room.
Visit our site and see what’s on offer.</em></p>

usability of your design. If you don’t hide hotspot hints, end-users/clients will be given clues to know where to
click.</p></li>
<li><p>Even with 4 - 5 scenarios, you might end up creating many of screens for your paper prototype. You can organise
your screens into <strong>sections</strong> on Marvel. Checkout this series of short

<h3>Prototyping - An Example<a class="headerlink" href="#prototyping-an-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s walk through an example.  Let’s say you are designing an application for universities that will help university
students decide which subjects to take in the future. Your clients have told you that they want the application to
be a mobile app.</p>
<div class="admonition-reminder admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Reminder</p>
<p>Your paper prototype is an early draft of your design - it should be rapidly designed, simulated and tested with
users. Please be careful with the level of details you put into it.  It needs to show major navigation and major
content elements. It does <strong>NOT</strong> need to show colours, images or meaningful contents.</p>
</div>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Create your first project according to the <a class="reference external" href="#create-your-first-project">create your first project</a> section.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s design the first page - Home page.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Click on “Start designing” <img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel6.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Firstly, our Home page can show some basic information about the user who has logged in. Let’s create a profile
image icon. Select the icon options on the toolbar.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel7.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Let’s pick the 2nd one, and add it to our design.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel8.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, we can add some basic information about the user. Select the text option, and add text in our design.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel9.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>For now, our page looks like:<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel10.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Next, we decide that some subjects should be listed.  They should be categorised into “Compulsory” (student
must complete this subject as part of the course) and “Optional”. We can add some rectangles to represent subjects:<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel11.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Our page looks like this now:<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel12.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>We are done with the design.  Let’s close this page.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel13.JPG" /></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s design the next page - a subject’s page.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Let’s create a new image.<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel14.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>According to our clients’ requirements, a subject’s page should have the subject’s name, a description, area of
interests it relates to, advice from teaching staffs and past students, and a button to go back to the home page.
The outcome might look like:<br />
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel15.JPG" /></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s say we are done with our design our pages (for now).  Let’s design the interactions between the two pages
we created.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hover your mouse over the Home page, click “Prototype” to add interactions.
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel16.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Click and drag to draw a hotspot (hotspot is an interactive area to enable users move between screens)
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel17.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Next, select the next screen you want to transition to. <img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel18.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Next, select the transition type. <img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel19.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>Next, select the action that triggers the transition (i.e. is it a click, tap, or?) <img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel20.JPG" /></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s say we are done with designing the interactions between screens. Select the “Play” button in the top right
corner to watch the transition you just created.
<img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel21.JPG" /></p></li>
<li><p>To share paper prototype with your client so that you can run usability test with them, click “Share”, copy the
link, and send it with them. <img alt="" src="../_images/Marvel22.JPG" /></p></li>

<h3>Before you Start Prototyping<a class="headerlink" href="#before-you-start-prototyping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You have completed your paper prototype and collected feedback from your clients.  Now you can use the feedback you
receive to create digital (high-fidelity) prototype that is much closer to what the final version of system-to-be
would look like.</p>
<p>Similar to paper (low-fidelity) prototype, you will use your digital prototype to run usability tests with
end-users/clients, collect more feedback, and refine your design. If you discover any problem during usability
testing, you can go back and modify your design.  By the end of the process, you have a validated prototype
before you start coding.</p>

<p>Compared to low-fidelity prototype, high-fidelity prototype is much closer to the final version of your
system-to-be. You need to be a lot more specific, introducing colour scheme, styling, images and meaningful,
realistic content into it. There are not only major navigation elements, but also the more detailed ones in digital
prototype. It is what the real product would look like - except there is no code.</p>

<div class="section" id="no-2-completeness-of-scenarios">
<h4>No.2: Completeness of Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#no-2-completeness-of-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
